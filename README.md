# Dotfiles & Linux Scripts
A collection of my dotfiles and personal scripts for Linux, including a darker Breeze theme for KDE.

## How I am organizing these
Folders are like "layers" of organization from top to bottom, from the application it is for to the type of file.

1. Bootloader, Kernel, Desktop Environment, etc.
2. Name of Bootloader, Kernel, DE, etc.
3. What it is for (color schemes, themes, etc.)
4. The script or config file(s) themselves
